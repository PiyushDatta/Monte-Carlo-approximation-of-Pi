We want you to develop an application that performs a Monte Carlo approximation of Pi 
(https://curiosity-driven.org/pi-approximation). This will not be a simple front end exercise – we expect you to be able 
to navigate the entire stack from database to UI. The requirements are listed below (complete as many as possible 
with the time you have): 

1. Set up any database of your choice 
2. Write a script to fill a table (required columns: x and y) with any number of points (the more, the better the approximation). Values of x and y should be anywhere between 0 and 1. You are free to add more columns as you see fit. 
3. Create an API to pull the points from the database table
4. Design an application front end that calls to the API to get the point objects 
5. The front end should display a circle within a square and points should be rendered to that diagram every time the API is called
6. There should be a button to start and stop the simulation (the points should be added in an animation one at a time) - there should also be buttons to restart the simulation, as well as to add a single point 
7. There should be a live visualization of the approximation calculation, the number of points within the circle, and the total number of points 
8. Deploy the application to the cloud 

Bonus: The app is visually well-designed
